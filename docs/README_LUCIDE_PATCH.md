# Patch: Add lucide-react

Fixes build error:
`Cannot find module 'lucide-react'`

What changed:
- Added `"lucide-react": "^0.462.0"` to dependencies.
- Bumped package.json version to 0.1.4.

Apply:
1) Replace or merge this `package.json` into your repo.
2) Run `npm i`.
3) Redeploy.

Notes:
- You still have ESLint warnings about `<img>`. Optional follow-up: swap to `next/image` to silence them.
- If you prefer pinning exact versions, lock in your package manager config after install.
