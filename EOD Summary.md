# End of Day Summary (2025-10-03)

**What we delivered today**
- Built the Edit Profile modal:
  - Checkbox list for notification channels.
  - Coloured chip selection for interests and shops, with unselected items reordered.
  - All buttons styled consistently with your login/logout buttons.
- Extended the Upcoming Events section:
  - Toggle buttons (List/Calendar) restyled with pink highlight.
  - “Add Event” button styled as pink primary.
  - Added Add Event modal with inputs for type, date, notes, budget, recurrence, friend selection, and optional draw date.
- Added server endpoints:
  - POST /account/profile → upsert profile data.
  - POST /account/events → insert new events.
- Provided Supabase SQL starter notes for `profiles`, `friends`, `event_types`, and `events` tables, including RLS policies.

**Fixes & improvements**
- Addressed ESLint issues: no-explicit-any, unused vars, etc.
- Worked around Supabase’s `never` typing on `.insert` and `.upsert` without resorting to `any` or `@ts-expect-error`.

**Next steps for tomorrow**
- Generate Supabase types and use a fully typed client to remove temporary shims.
- Wire Add Event modal to live `event_types` and `friends` data from Supabase.
- Implement avatar upload to Supabase Storage and surface via signed/public URL.
- Add toasts and optimistic UI refresh after save/create actions.
