# Gift Huddle – Backlog

This file tracks outstanding items and follow-ups that are not yet resolved. 
It complements the changelog in `README.md`.

## Outstanding Items

- Convert Baloo 2 wordmark to outlined paths (remove font dependency in SVG logo).
- Finalize header-optimized logo cropping at ~32px height (verify visual balance across breakpoints).
- Ensure favicon set is tested across browsers (Safari pinned tab, Windows ICO rendering, Android web app).
- Review font integration sitewide – confirm Baloo 2 loads consistently with no flash of unstyled text (FOUT).
- Consider additional logo variants (monochrome, dark mode, high-contrast accessibility).
