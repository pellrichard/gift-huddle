# Login UI fixes
- Container width set to **73rem** (matches header width) via Tailwind class `max-w-[73rem]` and centered with `mx-auto`.
- Branded OAuth buttons with logos and colors (Google, Apple, Facebook).
- "Continue to your account" uses a plain `<a>` (server-rendered) for maximum reliability.
