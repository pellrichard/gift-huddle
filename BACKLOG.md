## ü§ñ ChatGPT Context
(This section is for guiding how ChatGPT and user collaborate on backlog management.)

- Daily Notes are appended here each session to capture work done and next steps.
- Outstanding section only shows **active items** not yet finished.
- Completed section grows over time as tasks are resolved.
- GitHub and Vercel logs track commit/build history, so no need to duplicate that here.
- ChatGPT should always move items between sections as they are completed or created.
