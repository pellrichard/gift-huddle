# UI Stubs for Account Page

Adds minimal UI components to satisfy imports used by `components/account/AccountPage.tsx`:

- `src/components/ui/button.tsx`
- `src/components/ui/card.tsx`
- `src/components/ui/input.tsx`
- `src/components/ui/avatar.tsx`

These are simple Tailwind-based components. They can later be replaced with shadcn/ui or your design system.
