- Onboarding edit-bypass & logging tweaks (2025-10-01)
  - `app/onboarding/page.tsx`: Redirects to `/account` if profile is already complete, unless `?edit=1` is present. Keeps error banner.
  - `app/account/page.tsx`: Adds "Manage preferences" button linking to `/onboarding?edit=1`.
  - `app/onboarding/update/route.ts`: Limits logs to errors only in production; keeps detailed logs in dev; UPSERT stays.
