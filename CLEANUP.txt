CLEANUP INSTRUCTIONS (Consolidate to single app/ tree)

1) Delete the entire folder: src/app
   This removes duplicate Next.js "app" tree so only /app is used.

   On Windows (PowerShell):
     Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .\src\app

   On macOS/Linux:
     rm -rf ./src/app

2) No other folders in src/ are removed. We still keep src/lib, src/components, etc.

3) New files added by this patch:
     - app/api/waitlist/route.ts   (moved from src/app/api/waitlist)
     - app/favicon.ico             (moved from src/app/favicon.ico if it existed)

After applying this patch and cleanup, run:
  npm run build
  npm run dev
