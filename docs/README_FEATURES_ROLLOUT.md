# Rollout: Features Page

Adds a new `/features` page with:
- Intro explaining the concept.
- "Create events" section with a curated list of popular events.
- Core features grid (friends list, birthdays, reminders, kids safeguards, apps, privacy, budgets, shops).

## Files
- `app/features/page.tsx`

The page reuses the hero illustration at top-right. TailwindCSS utility classes are used.
